Watch the tutorial on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/1S8X03tm3-8?si=aPQY8Id6GBd-21Uc) or [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12YQZBqE1b/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=57f46145c37bfb96f7583c9e02081590)!

## 1. Dataset & Hardware Setup

Before deploying on the physical robot, it is highly recommended to obtain the code and test the algorithm using the provided dataset.

### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the Deep Robotics specific version of the repository, to your workspace source folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepRoboticsLab/lightning-lm-deep-robotics.git
```


### M20 Dataset
Download the test dataset collected on the M20 robot here:
*   **Google Drive:** [M20 Robot Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19T__ai6u5WCTwyWi3L4KC9gVZI-jiQM-?usp=drive_link)
*   *Note: This dataset contains `lidar_data_bag`, which is used in the examples below.*

We also have a larger and harder [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dAoFarl1nb6sMvoKAEhMDwgeG8ujeo_f?usp=drive_link) recording the M20 robot moving around the main librady at Zhejiang University. This dataset contains aggressive and shaking movements of legged robots. The lite3 lidar dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12alT4TuZwYC_xWUrex2quWOoMKXzpbQ2?usp=drive_link). You can use  `src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_livox.yaml` to test this algorithm. There are also videos recording what the robot looks like when collecting the lidar data.

### M20 Hardware Configuration
For details on how to configure and use the RoboSense LiDAR specific to the M20 robot, refer to the official documentation:
*   **LiDAR Usage Guide:** [Deep Robotics M20 LiDAR Docs](https://alidocs.dingtalk.com/i/p/OlnXRl7ed542DGLp/docs/qnYMoO1rWxDL7r6LHbad2kA9W47Z3je9)

## 2. Build Instructions

### Step 1: Install APT Dependencies

Do **not** install `libgoogle-glog-dev` from apt — it conflicts with the thirdparty glog v0.6.0 (both register the same gflags flags at startup, causing a crash on launch). Install everything else:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libopencv-dev libpcl-dev pcl-tools libyaml-cpp-dev libepoxy-dev libgflags-dev python3-wheel ros-humble-pcl-conversions 
```

If `libgoogle-glog-dev` is already installed, remove it:
```bash
sudo apt remove -y libgoogle-glog-dev libgoogle-glog0v5
```

### Step 2: Build glog v0.6.0 from Thirdparty

```bash
cd src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/thirdparty/glog
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ../../../../..
```

### Step 3: Build Pangolin v0.9.3 from Thirdparty

```bash
cd src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/thirdparty/Pangolin
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_TOOLS=OFF -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Wno-error" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ../../../../..
```

### Step 4: Build lightning-lm

**Standard build** (PC/Server with sufficient RAM):
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source install/setup.bash
```

**Low memory build** (recommended for on-board computers such as M20/RK3588, to avoid OOM crashes):
```bash
export MAKEFLAGS="-j3"
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --parallel-workers 3 --executor sequential --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source install/setup.bash
```
Compilation on RK3588 takes approximately 10 minutes; using 4 cores may hang the system due to Out of Memory (OOM) issues.

## 3. Configuration

The primary configuration file for the M20 robot is located at:
`src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_robotics.yaml`

**Key Configuration Parameters:**
*   **LiDAR Type:** Ensure `fasterlio.lidar_type` is set to `4` (RoboSense).
*   **Topics:** Check that `common.lidar_topic` and `common.imu_topic` match the sensor output in your bag or live stream.

## 4. Mapping (SLAM)

### Option A: Real-time Mapping (Online)
*Suitable for testing on the robot or playing back bags in real-time simulation.*

1.  **Play the ROS2 bag:**
    ```bash
    ros2 bag play ~/Downloads/m20/lidar_data_bag --clock
    ```
    *Note: Real-time processing is resource-intensive. On WSL/Virtual Machines, playback speed might need to be reduced.*

2.  **Launch the Online SLAM Node:**
    ```bash
    ros2 run lightning run_slam_online --config src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_robotics.yaml
    ```

3.  **Save the Map:**
    Once mapping is complete, save the result to disk:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call lightning/save_map lightning/srv/SaveMap "{map_id: new_map}"
    ```
4. **Log the localization state:**
    Check the realtime odometry of SLAM by running `ros2 topic echo /lightning/nav_state`, it will list position, attitude quaternion and velocity.


### Option B: Offline Mapping (Fast)
*Recommended for quickly generating maps from recorded data without dropping frames.*

1.  **Run Offline SLAM:**
    ```bash
    ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --input_bag /home/msy/Downloads/m20/lidar_data_bag/lidar_data_bag_0.db3 --config ./src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_robotics.yaml
    ```
    *Note: The system automatically saves results to the `data/new_map` directory upon completion.*

### Viewing the Map Results
*   **3D Point Cloud:**
    ```bash
    pcl_viewer ./data/new_map/global.pcd
    ```
*   **2D Grid Map:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install feh
    feh data/new_map/map.pgm
    ```

## 5. Localization

### Option A: Real-time Localization (Online)
*No UI is shown by default for this mode.*

1.  **Play the ROS2 bag (or run on live robot):**
    ```bash
    ros2 bag play ~/Downloads/m20/lidar_data_bag --clock
    ```

2.  **Launch the Localization Node:**
    *   Ensure `system.map_path` in your yaml config points to the folder containing the map (default: `new_map`).
    *   **Run command:**
        ```bash
        ros2 run lightning run_loc_online --config ./src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_roboticsloc.yaml
        ```

### Option B: Offline Localization
Run localization on a bag file without real-time constraints to verify algorithm performance.
```bash
ros2 run lightning run_loc_offline --config ./src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_roboticsloc.yaml --input_bag [path_to_bag]
```

## 6. M20 Hardware Deployment
We test on the AOS(103) platform, which has ROS2_foxy already.

### 6.1 Hardware Configuration
#### 6.1.1 Networking
Connect the AOS(103) host to the network.
Modify `vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf` and delete `unmanaged-devices` and all the `[keyfile]` section and reboot.

Running `nmcli d wifi list` should then display all available WiFi networks.
Set the name and connect using:
`sudo nmcli d wifi connect "<wifiname>" password "password" ifname wlan0`.

To maintain a continuous rviz display while the robot is moving, ensure a persistent WiFi connection between your computer and the M20 robot. is maintained.

#### 6.1.2 Point Cloud Permissions
Enable the service on the NOS(106) host and select the `user` account.
```bash
ssh user@10.21.31.106
sudo systemctl start multicast-relay.service
```
To check status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status multicast-relay.service
```
Or just enable auto service, so next time restart robot it works permernatly:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable multicast-relay.service
```
Once complete, switch to the AOS(103), enter `su` mode, password is '(a single comma), and check the point cloud:
```bash
source /opt/robot/scripts/setup_ros2.sh
ros2 topic hz /LIDAR/POINTS
```
These steps are required for each SLAM try, in other words, always check LiDAR topic accessibility first.

### 6.2 Preparation
#### 6.2.1 Dependencies

Follow **Steps 1–4** from the [Build Instructions](#step-4-build-lightning-lm) section above.  On M20, transfer the code to the robot using scp and use the Low Memory Build in Step 4.

> **Note:** On M20 the ROS 2 distro is Foxy — replace `ros-humble-pcl-conversions` with `ros-foxy-pcl-conversions` in the apt install command, and source `/opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash` instead of humble.

#### 6.2.2 M20 Visualization Issues
3D UI window in `run_slam_online` crash when starting the `pangolin`, primarily due to **OpenGL/EGL context initialization failure**. Error is `eglGetBindAPI(0x30a2) failed: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER (300c)`.
Due to compatibility issues with EGL + OpenGL support on the RK3588, Pangolin visualization (and other OpenGL applications) may fail to open.

Therefore, this modified version primarily utilizes **rviz2 for visualization**. 

### 6.3 Recodring bags
Recodring realtime topic related to LIO to bags can by running:
```bash
taskset -c 4,5,6,7 chrt 90 ros2 bag record -o lio260310 /tf /IMU /LIDAR/POINTS
```

## 7. SLAM Test
Make sure:
- The robot is standing when starting program, since system may substract under ground points.
- Verify that the input point cloud topic is visible.
- Dynamic obstacles like cars and people may degrade system performance. In narrow tunnels or when the LiDAR is obstructed, localization may be lost.

So that we use `run_slam_online` node.


### 7.1 One-command Launch
To monitor the SLAM program in one single remote terminal, use the following command to launch 4 tmux windows at once (stay at your workspace folder which is the parent folder of the src folder): 
```bash
./src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/start_lg_rviz_session.sh
```
This opens a session named `lg`. Switch between windows using `Ctrl+b n`. If a command fails, you can manually re-enter it as described in the next section.

Further instructions see [tmux session usage](#94-tmux-session-usage)

### 7.2 Manual Startup (Step-by-Step)

Mapping mode requires at least 4 windows to run each component:
```bash
ros2 run lightning run_slam_online --config src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_roboticsslam.yaml

rviz2 -d src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/showbodypc.rviz

ros2 topic echo /lightning/nav_state
ros2 service call /lightning/save_map lightning/srv/SaveMap "{map_id: 'office4'}"
```

The `/lightning/odom` odometry, and `/lightning/path` in 'map' frame, topics will be visible here.


### 7.3 log pose and velocity
Trun on `system.pub_odom` and `ros2 topic echo /lightning/nav_state` to list position, attitude quaternion and velocity. It's independent on TF.

Also you can run `ros2 service call /lightning/save_path lightning/srv/SavePath "{file_path: 'data/traj.txt'}" ` any time to save a TUM style trajectory.

Then you can use Python's matplotlib to visualize the path:
```bash
python3 src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/scripts/visualize_trajectory.py data/traj.txt
```

## 8. Localization test
We test `run_loc_online` node.
The procedure is basically the same as SLAM, but you need to ensure the map configuration is correct. Check the pointcloud in map path exists in the yaml file you loaded like default_deep_robotics.yaml:
```yaml
system:
  map_path: ./data/office4/
```
And verify the point cloud with `pcl_viewer ./data/office4/global.pcd`.

### 8.1 start Loc online
Localiztion mode, you need at least 3 windows to each typing these commands.
```bash
ros2 run lightning run_loc_online --config src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/default_deep_roboticsloc.yaml

rviz2 -d src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/showglobalmap.rviz

ros2 topic echo /lightning/nav_state
```

### 8.2 One-command Launch
By running: 
```bash
./src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/sloc_rviz_session.sh
```
This use tmux to open 4 windows in a session named `loc`, the 4th window is left free, you can try SavePath service.

## 9. Configuration & Check the result
In this project by default we enable `pub_tf` for rviz2 visualization.


### 9.1 Mapping mode configuration
For the purpose of:
1. Print or publish localization state and odometry messages.
2. Optionally publish mapping result like point clouds and path.

the following options are added in yaml
```yaml
system:
  log_pose_opt: false               # Print pos/vel directly to terminal
  pub_odom: true                    # Publish odometry topic
  enable_lidar_loc_rviz: false      # Enable RViz point cloud publishing
  rviz_current_scan_topic: "/current_scan_cloud"
  rviz_global_map_topic: "/global_map_cloud"
  enable_path_rviz: true            
  pub_tf: true                      
```

By default pointcloud is not published. The config file provides basic need for path saving, nav_state logging.

### 9.2 Localization mode configuration
Firstly check the map_path is correct when running `loc_online` mode. 

If you need to manually set another initial pose, use the following in the config:
```yaml
system:
  map_path: ./data/office4/
  use_init_pose: true
  init_pos: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]         # Initial position in the point cloud [x, y, z]
  init_quat: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]   # Initial quaternion relative to the global map [x, y, z, w]
```


### 9.3 tf Check
We publish the `map->lidar_link` transform in `slamOnline` for visualization. Note that `pub_tf` only exists in the `LocSystem` of the original version.

```bash
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
ros2 topic echo /tf
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo base_link lidar_link
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link
```

### 9.4 tmux session usage
Use `Ctrl+b` followed by `0`/`1`/`2`/`4` to switch between the 4 sub-windows.
```bash
Ctrl+b, d # Detach from session
Ctrl+b, c # Create a new tab
su
tmux attach -t lg # Re-attach to the session
tmux kill-session -t lg # Kill the session
```
If the session is disconnected due to network failure, you can attach to this session again. After MobaXterm reconnecting, in `su` mode run `tmux attach -t lg` will be back to the running program. `Ctrl+b 0` to see the running of SLAM/Loc node.


### 9.5 rviz2 instructions for Real-time Visualization
Although the original Pangolin interface is more efficient, rviz2 visualization is also provided.

The rviz display:
- tf, `map->lidar_link`
- Odometry, `/lightning/odom`
- PointCloud2-currentScan, `/current_scan_cloud`
- PointCloud2-globalMap, `/global_map_cloud`
- Path: `/lightning/path`

The currentScan is transformed to the global 'map' frame and processed by Undistortion and Downsampling.  For SLAM mode, the globalMap is updated by KeyFrame updating. For Localization mode, the global map is set by the input file, which remains constant during online operation. The latter ones are not published every second.

Note: rviz2 works on MobaXterm, not on VSCode.

#### 9.5.1 Reconnected rviz2
If the network connection is interrupted due to a failure and the next time reconnected, you can restart RViz2 as follows:
```bash
source /opt/robot/scripts/setup_ros2.sh
pkill -f rviz2
rviz2 -d src/lightning-lm-deep-robotics/config/showbodypc.rviz
```
